# CalendarApp
1/19/18
I hate most calender/scheduler apps.
This app is intended for my personal use to give me a calendar that I have full control over.

I like to add extensive notes sometimes to my calendar (just like the big paper planners from university in the '00s). Most of the planner apps I've tried of late don't seem to handle this well. I want to build something that I configure exactly the way I want it. Front end is nearly finished. Back end will eventually be running Node.

More updates soon.
